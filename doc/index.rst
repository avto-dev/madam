Welcome to MADAM
================
MADAM is a digital asset management library. It aims to facilitate the handling of image, audio, and video files by helping out with several tasks:

    - **Organization:** MADAM helps you to organize media data by providing means to read and store media files. Once the files are stored, the database can be queried based on the metadata that is present in the media files (e.g. XMP, Exif, â€¦) or based on derived properties such as file size or the duration of a sound file.
    - **Processing:** MADAM possesses extensible media processing capabilities. Images, for example, can be optimized for display on mobile devices by applying a resize, a format conversion, and a sharpening operator.
